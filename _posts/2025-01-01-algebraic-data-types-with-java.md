## Introduction

## What are Algebraic Data Types (ADT)?

ADTs provide a way to define composite data types by combining other types in a structured and type-safe manner. They allow developers to model complex data structures using simpler building blocks, much like building with LEGOs.  Think of them as custom, compound data types you design for your specific needs.

## Why do we need them and what kind of problems to they help solve?

ADTs make code more readable by explicitly defining the structure and possible values of complex data. This makes it easier to understand and reason about the code, leading to improved maintainability.

ADTs use the type system to enforce constraints on the data. The compiler can detect errors at compile time, preventing runtime issues that might arise from invalid data structures or operations.

Compared to using classes or structs alone, ADTs can often reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed to define and manipulate complex data. For example, pattern matching with ADTs often eliminates the need for lengthy if-else chains or switch statements.

ADTs can accurately model data that has a limited set of possible states or variations. This is particularly useful for representing things like:

- State machines: Each state can be a variant of an ADT.
- Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs): Used in compilers and interpreters to represent the structure of code.
- Error Handling: An ADT can represent either a successful result or a specific error.
In essence, ADTs help by allowing us to model the application domain by defining custom data types that are tailor-made for a specific application domain and enforced by the type system. 
They provide a powerful tool for tackling complexity in software engineering.

## A Bit of History

Before we get into recent changes in Java that help us exploit ADTs lets take a little detour into the history od ADTs

ADTs are not a new idea.  Java has been able to simulate them to some extent since enums were introduced in 1.1 (date?), but the ideas go back much further.

In the 1960's a kind of ADT known as a tagged union which later became part of the C language.  Here the tag is a value that indicates the variant of the enum stored in the union.
This allows a structure that is the Sum of different types.

By the mid 1970s,  In Standard ML, ADTs are defined using the datatype keyword. They allow you to create new types as a combination of constructors, each potentially holding values of other types.  

Essentially, datatype lets you build custom, compound types with named constructors and pattern matching lets you effectively use them.
